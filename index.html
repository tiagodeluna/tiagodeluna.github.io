    <section class="main-content">
      <p>I'm a Brazilian full-stack developer and an enthusiastic gamer. I have been programming for over 8 years, both in the private sector and public sector -- developing systems for the Ministry of Labour and Social Security in Brazil. I am very comfortable coding in Java, HTML/CSS, and C#, but I've been working with many other languages, frameworks, and technologies.</p>

<p>I graduated in Systems Analysis and Development in 2008, and most recently, I started a course in Digital Games Development. I am passionate about web development, game design, and a great enthusiastic and supporter of the hobby of tabletop games and video games.</p>
